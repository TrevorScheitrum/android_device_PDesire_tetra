Android Wear device tree for Sony Smartwatch 3 (SWR50).

To get this working, you need to obtain clockwork sources from the Google Business Partner repos

What has to be done is to add all Nougat Kernel commits to SW3 kernel. The other sources (with Google Clockwork and vendor) do get released then so you can try to succeed.

I am ready to give advices about porting and so on. 

Btw it seems that I've got SoftIP banned by Google from partner repos 

I'm sorry for that, but we've tried our best. In hope there's a Dev who can finish it. Offend me, hate me, don't believe in me but well that's how it ended now. 

But at the other side: we made successful steps in porting it, so we can maybe achieve our goal someday.

For the openness and freedom of the project, the code will be BSD-3-Clause Licensed. Could be interesting for FitWear devs
